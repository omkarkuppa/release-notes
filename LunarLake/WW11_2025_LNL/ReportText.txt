  BTG-Verified IBB Should not be Evicted from Cache
  
  [Issue Description]
  On LNL since cache was default-disabled in Real16ToFlat32.asm, there
  were issues with boot in SecCpuLib.nasm x64. The fix involved
  invalidated cache and setting up CR0 again in HSD 18025778439.
  This fix may allow for boot but does not take into account Boot Guard
  security concerns with regard to SPI interposer type attacks
  ^^^^^^^^                                                     
  
  [Resolution]
  Modify Real16ToFlat32.asm (already done in public Edk2 and
  mirror via separate PR), and then here get rid of the cache disable/re-
  enable
  
  Package/Module: SecCpuLib
  
  [Impacted Platform]
