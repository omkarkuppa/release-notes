    Core allocate aligned-memory service will allocate double of required size for base alignment, the memory overhead will be recycled back to memory map. However memory used by FSP would be marked as reserved, that can never take it back. Move memory allocation from Si (FSP) to platform (boot loader), and pass allocated base via policy for silicon to do following initialization.
    1. Move memory allocation from silicon to platform, add a policy/UPD that carries allocated memory base.
    2. Make trace memory to BWG default : PCH (64MB/64MB) / CPU (128MB/128MB) to handle memory allocation for SCRPD0[24] set even when TraceHubMode is disabled.
    3. Add trace hub memory check, if total (CPU+PCH) TH memory size over 512MB, enforce them to BWG default. ( PCH (64MB/64MB) / CPU (128MB/128MB))

    517649:[220511085][CFL][MRC] Update BDAT Schema within MrcFillRmtBdatStructure
    
    Due to lack of compatibility for the EvLoader with FSP based BIOS, the decision was made for CFL to publish the MRC RMT results through BDAT Schema.
    
    The BDAT Schema is being updated to Schema 6 for future compatibility with any further functionality for MRC results being published through BDAT (Margin 1D, 2D and/or Bit/Byte level results)
    
    The BDAT Enable is disabled by default, and will need to be enabled through the BIOS Setup menu, or through hardcoded value within the BIOS. Also, the Rank Margin Tool Training step must be enabled to receive the RMT data in BDAT.
    
    Additional Change:
    Re-enable RMT by default within SaSetup, the default was incorrectly set to disabled by default in CL#366235

    517352:[HSD-ES][client_platf][1305242265][cannon_lake]MRC Failure in Late command training on CNL U with DDR4 2R DIMMs at top frequency bins
    https://hsdes.intel.com/appstore/article/#/1305242265
    
    Issue:
    MRC fails LCT with new Micron Engineering samples on CNL U6
    PN: MTA16ATF2G64HZ-3G2EYES ( PC4-3200)
    Both channels and each channel separately on 1867.
    
    Root cause:
      Cache coherency issue between the the trained value of the PI's and the value from shifting the clock.  We eat into the tDQSS and Receive Enable margin.  At 1867 and high frequencies, we fail late command training due to not enough margin.
    
    Solution:
      Instead of relying on the register cache to store the trained value, we need to track this inside the MRC global data structure.  Added parameter for RcvEn, TxDq, and TxDqs.  ShiftDQPIs will use to store the trained value when UpdateHost == FALSE.  GetSet cache will reflect exactly what the register is programmed to.
    
    Other Changes:
      Removed an unused parameter on ShiftCh2Ch: SkipTx.
      Cleaned up ICL comments in MRC interfaces to BIOS as they are now separate platform packages.
      Default MiniBIOS to always read from SPD if DDR4 boards are detected.
      Removed IntControllerOut->TxVref[] as this was only used for LPDDR3 which is no longer POR.
      Removed LPDDR3 code from ShiftPIforCmdTraining()
      Remove Warm Reset Scrubbing message to CSME in DID as this is depracated for CFL.

    517165:220400529: [MRC] Update Low Supply Enable configuration per MRC HAS 1.0
    
    HSD: https://hsdes.intel.com/appstore/article/#/220400529
    
    Description:
    
    Step-specific instructions:
    ?         CNL C0, CNL-H 6+2 and earlier dies; also true for ICL-A0!
    Due to a bug, CTL and CMD should not enable LowSupEn:
    DdrCrCtlControls1.CTLLowsupEn = 0,
    DdrCrCtlControls1.CKELowsupEn = 0
    DdrCrCompCtl2.CTLLowsupEn = 0
    DdrCrCtlControls1.CMDLowsupEn = 0
    DdrCrCmdControls1.CMDLowsupEn = 0
    DdrCrCompCtl2.CMDLowsupEn = 0
    ?         CNL D0 and 8+2 dies (and for ICL starting w/ B0):
    DdrCrCtlControls1.CKELowsupEn = 0 <- CKE must have keep the levels higher than Vccio
    DdrCrCtlControls1.CTLLowsupEn = 0  // Must follow CKE since they have common COMP
    DdrCrCompCtl2.CTLLowsupEn = 0  // Must follow CKE since they have common COMP
    DdrCrCtlControls1.CMDLowsupEn = 1
    DdrCrCmdControls1.CMDLowsupEn = 1
    DdrCrCompCtl2.CMDLowsupEn = 1
    
    Changes:
    
    Disable low supply enable for C0 and lower steppings in ULT_ULX and P0 and lower settings for Dt/Halo and disable mainly for CTL and CKE.
